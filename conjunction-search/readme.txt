IMPORT FILES
conj_gen.py - python file for finding conjunctions
intervals.pkl - < 1000 km intervals, table with datetime (timezone aware), unix, julian date - necessary to run 'conj_gen.py'
whi_int.pkl - intervals in which WHISPER data is available in datetime (timezone aware)
26464tle.txt - C2 TLE between 2010-10-01 and 2011-12-01 (I think) - necessary to run 'conj_gen.py'


JUPYTER FILES
API-get.ipynb - commented sufficiently. obtains list of eligible satellites and conjunction data for those satellites
conj-plot.ipynb - for plotting the 3-dim orbits at conjunction. contains some functions that I may turn into a .py -
    'find_TLE' asks space-track API to return TLE given satellite NORAD CAT ID and epoch range
    'conj_gen' returns, given the TCA, two position arrays (for chosen satellite and C2) within [hrs] on either side of TCA


DATA FILES
satIds_1.json - generated by 'API-get.ipynb'; list of NORAD CAT IDs with launch date < 2010-10-01 and decay > 2012-01-01
satIds_2.json - generated by 'API-get.ipynb'; list of NORAD CAT IDs with launch date < 2010-10-01 and decay = null_val

noTLE45_200.npy - np list of NORAD CAT IDs in which historical TLEs are not available, missing data from satIds_1.json 45:200
all_conj.pkl - all 'conjunctions' concatenated and re-indexed
